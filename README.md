# Phishing Detection using LLM

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an AI-based **Phishing Detection System** that classifies a given message or email as **Phishing** or **Legitimate** using Machine Learning and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques.

The goal of this project is to improve cybersecurity by automatically detecting phishing attempts.
